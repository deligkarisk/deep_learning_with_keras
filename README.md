# Deep Learning Analysis in Python
Author: Kosmas Deligkaris

This repository contains some scripts for deep learning analysis in python.

I have taken ideas and some code from the book "Deep Learning with Python" [Manning] by Francois Chollet, and the examples have been further extended by me.

## imdb classification
The script analyzes the effect of increasing layer size on the loss and accuracy values.

## housing prices regression
The script conducts regression of housing prices.

## mnist classification
